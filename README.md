# Wheather-Forecast-CLI-tool

Python Wheather-forecast-tool.py 'City_Name' 


This command-line tool allows you to fetch and display the current weather forecast for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It is implemented in Python and demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can assist with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tool, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3 installed on your machine.
- An API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) after creating an account.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

3. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the code with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

4. Run the tool from the command line using the following command:

Python Wheather-forecast-tool.py 'City_Name' 


Replace `CITY_NAME` with the name of the city for which you want to get the weather forecast. You can also optionally provide the country or state name as a second command-line argument.

5. The tool will make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, parse the weather data, and display the forecast on the command line.
